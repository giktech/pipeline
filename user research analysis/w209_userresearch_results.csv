where did the data come from? is it sales data for one or more companies? (so we will probably need better specification text)

exploring the quarter data
taking a while to reload the dataset when filtering on qtrs

something happened on nov 24th that increased sales overall

Vitoria is doing the worst

tooltip for other charts is lacking - anything that would be helpful

qtr filter allows for nonconsecutive selections - maybe make it so that it fills in gaps or limit to 1 selection if selected

better explanation on the comparison charts ",2,,least popular: Books - general interest books,-99,1,least popular: Food,-99,1,least popular: Books - general interest books,-99,1,"least popular: Books - general interest books, home appliances, home construction",-99,1,2,"did filtering easily and correctly

didn't noticed the city filter

likes the exclude feature on the Tableau filters - but not a way to select multiple

maybe a bit crowded",,,,,,,,,,,"Would not have known to do the brushing thing - but recognizes the cross hairs symbol means to to something

unclear how much of a bar has to be highlighted for it to be counted? could use color highlighting

bottom chart axis labels are getting off

not sure what ""order"" means - there's order count and there's sales but what are they and how are they different? should have some indication of what the money part is

noticed the differences for order count v how much sales were

add something about dollar amount",2,2 instead of 1 because if they want to compare the product categories it's harder to match them,most: health & beauty least: books (did not use the sorting button),1,1,"most: bed, bath tables. least: food",1,1,most: health & beauty least: books ,1,1,"most:  bed, bath table least: tie: home construction/home appliances & books",1,1,1,,"Nov 24th 2017, used the qtrs filter ",65881,1,"bed, bath table",1,contagem,1,1,used drag to filter by a section of sales,,,,,,,,,,,"green for growth, red for negative between timepoints. 

the plain view is confusing - not sure what's going on before highlighting the lines

reading off the y values was challenging.

""I'm not sure what I'm actually seeing - maybe the 10 worst items when I do a brush select - I'm not seeing the whole range of items. Before there were like 60 and I only see 10 at a time when I select, that was a bit confusing.""
