# Research Plan

Our tool is built for use by high level executives and employees working on the floor. We will need a diverse audience from levels across the company to assess our tool.

Our sample will include several groups from across the company hierarchy.

* Group 1 (n=5):
* Group 2 (n=10):
* Group 3 (n=10):

In reality, we will ask these questions (or a shortened version) of our classmates and friends.

Our methods will include in-depth interviews with short tasks for the users to complete. We will use the responses to assess how well the tool can be used in it's current form and to collect ideas for improved implementation. Once the initial qualitative interviews are complete and the tool has been refined, we would consider distributing a follow up survey among departments who will use to this tool to assess how well they can use it to find different data and insights.

## Task Based Interviews

### Discussion Guide

Introduction to participant: Thank you for agreeing to participate in our research. I will ask you to complete a series of tasks with a visualization of an online store's order tracking pipeline. When completing these tasks, please think aloud and talk through how you're thinking about the task. We are interested in how you use the tool, what expectations you may have, and particularly where the tool falls short. Your honest feedback will help us to improve this tool for future use.

### Follow up Survey

After addressing the major concerns among the different groups, we will conduct a follow up survey of the departments and employees asking them to identify various components and complete various tasks. This will help us to assess our changes and how accurately the tool is being used.

The survey will consist of several tasks which will have 3-5 steps for instructions, 3-5 multiple choice follow up questions and 1 open ended question for any additional feedback, questions or explanation the participant would like to provide.
