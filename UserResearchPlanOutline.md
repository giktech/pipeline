# Task Based Interviews

## Interviewer Instructions

Go through the discussion guide with the participant, asking permission and recording the session if possible. Take notes, especially if not recording. Note when and how participants first attempt the tasks, if their first attempt is right/wrong, note how long the participant spends on each task (each task should take no more than a 1-2 minutes to complete), if any tasks are left incomplete or skipped, etc. Prompt with follow up questions if necessary and remember to prompt the user to think out loud as they work through the tasks.
